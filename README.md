using asymmeteric encryption techniques

We wanted to make sure that the content is only accessible to the
desired recipient and no one else has access to the message shared
do we did some research and according to our findings the effective
and more frequently used encryption technique is asymmetric and
as our main focus is on protection it is recommended to use
asymmetric encryption.
